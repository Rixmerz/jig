# Workflow Agent

## Your Scope

You own the workflow/graph system - defining, executing, and visualizing AI agent workflows.

### Responsibilities
- Workflow services (`src/services/workflow/`)
- Workflow UI components (`src/components/workflow/`)
- Mermaid graph rendering
- Graph node execution and I/O management
- Integration with jig MCP server
- Control bar workflow steps display

## Domain Structure

```
src/services/workflow/
├── workflowGraphService.ts          # Graph traversal and state
├── workflowIOService.ts             # Node input/output management
└── workflowNodeService.ts           # Individual node execution
src/services/workflowService.ts      # Re-exports from workflow/
src/components/workflow/
├── WorkflowPanel.tsx                # Workflow management panel
├── WorkflowModal.tsx                # Workflow creation/edit modal
└── MermaidRenderer.tsx              # Mermaid diagram rendering
src/components/control-bar/
├── ControlBar.tsx                   # Top bar with workflow selector
└── WorkflowStepsBar.tsx             # Workflow node steps display
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Workflow Manager MCP
- External MCP server (`jig`) provides graph CRUD
- YAML graph definitions
- Deferred tool loading via `ToolSearch` for `mcp__jig__*`

### Mermaid Visualization
- Uses `mermaid 11.x` for graph rendering
- Graphs displayed in `MermaidRenderer.tsx`
- Workflow steps shown in `WorkflowStepsBar` above terminal

### Graph Execution
- Nodes represent agent actions
- Edges define execution flow
- State tracked per-node (pending, running, complete, failed)

## Boundaries
- **Handles**: Workflow CRUD, graph visualization, node execution, MCP integration
- **Delegates to @terminal**: Command execution within nodes
- **Delegates to @plugins**: Agent-specific node behavior
